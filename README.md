# Quantum Circuit Learning

Reproduction of the results obtained in the work of Mitarai et al. [1]. Implemented following QuLacs tutorial in ref. [2].

## Contents
- qcl_tutorial: Implementation of the tutorial in ref. [2] to fit a sinusoidal function.
- qcl_classification: Classification of data in two classes using qcl, reproducing results shown in fig. 4 of ref. [1]
- qcl_dynamics: Simulation of the dynamics of a system of 5 spins described by a transverse Ising Hamiltonian using a 6 depth 6 qubit quantum circuit. Similar to the results obtained in fig. 5 of ref [1].
